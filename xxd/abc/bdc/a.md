xxd Project Description

## 🛠️ Build

This project uses [kmpkg](https://github.com/kumose/kmcmake) for dependency management and build integration.
`kmpkg` automatically handles third-party library downloads, dependency resolution, and compiler flag configuration, avoiding the need to manually maintain complex CMake settings.


### 0. Prepare the environment

- Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+ / CentOS 7+ Recommended)
- CMake >= 3.20
- GCC >= 9.4 / Clang >= 12
- Make sure `kmpkg` is installed correctly, documents see [installation guide](https://kumo-pub.github.io/docs/category/%E6%8C%81%E7%BB%AD%E9%9B%86%E6%88%90----kmpkg)

### 1.Configure the project (optional)

* For the complete dependencies, refer to [`kmpkg.json`](kmpkg.json)
* To update the dependency baseline, modify the `baseline` in `default-registry` of [`kmpkg-configuration.json`](kmpkg-configuration.json)
* the `baseline` can be obtained via `git log`.


### 2. Build the project

Run in the project root directory:

```bash
cmake --preset=defualt
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```
#### Using Manual Dependency Management

If you manage dependencies yourself, you can build the project
with standard CMake commands:

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

**Note**

- `--preset=default` requires that the corresponding CMake preset is defined in the project root directory.
- When managing dependencies manually, make sure CMake’s find_package can locate all required libraries.

### 3. Run Tests (Optional)

Run in the project root directory:

```shell
ctest --test-dir build
```
